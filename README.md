This project is designed to evaluate and compare the performance of five fundamental sorting algorithms: Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Heap Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort. The main goal is to analyze these algorithms based on the number of comparisons they make to sort an array of data and their time efficiency in milliseconds.

Comparisons: The total number of comparisons performed during the sorting process.

Time (Milliseconds): The total time taken to complete the sort, measured in milliseconds.
